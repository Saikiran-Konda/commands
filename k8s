     basic & smallest unit
     Abstrction over container

     new ip address on re-creation

         life cycle of pod and service not connected
         inernal service and externaml service foe out side world
ingress: 
secrets:
configmap:
statefulset:
Deployment:

  Deployment manges a replicaset
  Replicaset manages all replicas of that pod
  pod is an abstraction of a container
