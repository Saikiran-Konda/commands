Kubernetes:
volumes:
node:
pod: A Pod is similar to a set of containers with shared namespaces and shared filesystem volumes
     basic & smallest unit
     Abstrction over container
     usually 1 application per pod
     each pod gets its own ip address
     new ip address on re-creation
service: pod has its own service
         perminent ip address
         life cycle of pod and service not connected
         inernal service and externaml service foe out side world
ingress: 
secrets:
configmap:
statefulset: any application that can store data
  - stateful applications are like different database applications, and elastic search
    and other.
Deployment:


Layers of abstraction:
  Deployment manges a replicaset
  Replicaset manages all replicas of that pod
  pod is an abstraction of a container

Persistent Valueme(PVC):
  - A persistent volume is a piece of storage in a cluster that an administrator has provisioned.
  - It is a resource in the cluster, just as a node is a cluster resource.
  - A persistent volume is a volume plug-in that has a lifecycle independent of any individual pod that uses the persistent volume
